# DDGSS
 A small extension that stores your Duck Duck Go settings in private browsing mode.
 
 > If you were wondering DDGSS stands for Duck Duck Go Save Settings.

 > This was a minor annoyance that I was having, so I decided to make a quick extension for it (because firefox doesnt support local extensions very well).
